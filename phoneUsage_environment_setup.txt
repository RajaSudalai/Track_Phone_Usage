# Pedestrian Phone Usage detection and tracking using AlphaPose estimation and pose tracking model 


## Installation
##### 1. Create a conda virtual environment.
conda create -n trackPhoneUsage python=3.6 pandas scikit-learn  matplotlib opencv spyder notebook
conda activate trackPhoneUsage

##### 2. Install PyTorch
conda install pytorch==1.1.0 torchvision==0.3.0 -c pytorch

##### 3. Get Track_Phone_Usage project repo
git clone https://github.com/aivoyagers/Track_Phone_Usage.git
cd Track_Phone_Usage

##### 4. install
`export PATH=/usr/local/cuda/bin/:$PATH`

`export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/cuda/lib64/:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH`

`pip install cython`

- sudo apt-get install libyaml-dev
`pip install pyyaml`    

`python setup.py build develop`

##### 5. For Windows user, if you meet error with PyYaml, you can download and install it manually from here: https://pyyaml.org/wiki/PyYAML. If your OS platform is Windows, make sure that Windows C++ build tool like visual studio 15+ or visual c++ 2015+ is installed for training.

##### 6. Download Below pretrained and offline trained Models and training and validation datasets from the Google Drive https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ZyzRj-G6FolQ-qhJzOx1YkBptYtaWjeS?usp=sharing 
- Download Track_Phone_Usage folder from above google drive and merge it with cloned project folder. 
-- Download the object detection model manually: yolov3-spp.weights(Google Drive | Baidu pan). Place it into detector/yolo/data.
-- Download our pose models. Place them into pretrained_models. All models and details are available in our Model Zoo
-- Download data and place it in data folder of project root folder
-- Download build folder
